    <LI><h2><b>ENGINEERING</b></h2></LI>
    <p><i><b>The word "engineering" derives from the Latin ingenium, meaning "cleverness" or "native talent," and the Old French engineor, meaning "one who designs or constructs engines of war."</b></i></p>
    <p>Engineering is the practice of applying natural sciences, mathematics, and the engineering design process to solve problems, enhance efficiency, and improve systems across fields like infrastructure, machinery, electronics, materials, and energy .

    <li><h2><b>HISTORY</b></h2></li>
    <p>The roots of engineering trace back to ancient times, with early inventions such as the lever, pulley, wheel, and inclined plane .
        Notable early engineers include Imhotep (Step Pyramid, Egypt, ca. 2550 BCE) , and engineering achievements like Roman aqueducts, Gothic cathedrals, and Asian hydraulic systems demonstrate the discipline’s evolution .
        The term “engineering” originated from Middle English (engine’er), initially referring to creators of military devices; the modern meaning evolved alongside professionalization, particularly during the Industrial Revolution .</p>
